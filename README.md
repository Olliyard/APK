# Project: Urban Traffic Management Simulator
## Concept
Develop a simulator for managing urban traffic, focusing on the flow and control of vehicles at intersections, including traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, and emergency vehicle prioritization.
This project is inspired by the complexity and real-world applicability of such a management system.

### Topics covered:
___
* **Namespaces**: Organize code into logical sections like traffic control, vehicle management, and emergency services.
* **Templates** and Variadic Templates: Create generic data structures for vehicles and events, allowing for flexibility and reuse.
* **STL Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms**: Manage and process data related to vehicles, traffic lights, and routes.
* **Exceptions**: Handle unexpected situations like system errors or data inconsistencies.
* **Moving and Smart Pointers (Polymorphic Memory Resource)**: Efficiently manage memory for dynamic traffic data.
* **Threading**: Simulate real-time traffic flow and concurrent processing of multiple intersections.
* **Boost Signals2**: Implement event-driven responses to traffic changes, like emergency vehicle approach.
* **C++ Concepts and SFINAE**: Ensure type safety and correct template usage, particularly in vehicle and intersection management.
* **Metaprogramming**: Optimize traffic flow calculations and real-time decision-making processes.

## Structure
1. **Intersection Module**: Handles traffic light control and vehicle queues.
2. **Vehicle Module**: Represents different types of vehicles, including emergency vehicles.
3. **Traffic Control Center**: Coordinates between intersections, particularly for emergency vehicle prioritization.

**Key Features**
- Namespaces: Define separate namespaces for different modules.
- Templates: Create templates for handling different types of vehicles.
- STL Containers and Iterators: Use STL containers (like ``std::vector``, ``std::map``) to manage vehicles at intersections.
- Exceptions: Implement exception handling for error scenarios, like signal malfunction or data errors.
- Concurrency and Threading: Ensure thread safety when accessing shared resources.
- Boost Libraries Integration: Use Boost Signals2 for event-driven programming, such as changing traffic lights or responding to emergencies.
- C++ Concepts and SFINAE: Apply these for compile-time checks and template specialization.
- Metaprogramming: Use to optimize certain operations or calculations.

# To-do
- Start with setting up your development environment.
- Begin coding with the basic structure, focusing on the intersection and vehicle modules.
- Regularly commit your code to a version control system (if available) for tracking changes.
